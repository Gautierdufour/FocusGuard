<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">FocusGuard &mdash; Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

<p>
    FocusGuard ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
    This policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and your rights.
</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
<p>
    <strong>FocusGuard does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</strong>
    All information remains exclusively on your device.
</p>

<h2>2. Permissions and Why We Need Them</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</strong> — Used to detect which app is currently in the foreground
        so FocusGuard can enforce your blocking rules. This data is read locally and never leaves your device.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> — Used to display the full list of installed apps so you can
        choose which ones to block. No list is sent externally.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</strong> — Used to display the blocking overlay on top of restricted
        apps. Required for the core blocking feature to work.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</strong> — Used optionally for location-based blocking rules
        (e.g., block certain apps only when you are at a specific place). Location data is processed
        on-device and never transmitted.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
    All settings, schedules, and usage statistics created by FocusGuard are stored locally on your
    device using the Android Room database. Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all this data.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    FocusGuard does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDK.
    No data is shared with any third party.
</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
    FocusGuard is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from
    children. If you believe a child has provided data through the app, please contact us so we can
    take appropriate action.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated
    date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>
    If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at:<br>
